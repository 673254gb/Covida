Trigonometry (from Ancient Greek τρίγωνον (trígōnon) 'triangle', and μέτρον (métron) 'measure') is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships between side lengths and angles of triangles. The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies.
